# Loan Data Analysis Presentation

The presentation will consist of 40% ETL discussion, 30% test driven development (Gherkin), 30% demo of the ETL

## ETL discussion

I will cover the design of the ETL "framework" and talk about the thought process behind the design. I will cover the configuration file and how the modular design of the ETL allows the flexibility to develop multiple data source types and database connections/schemas. I will then give a demo of the ETL.

## Gherkin/TDD

Test driven development was a significant part of my project and it is worth devoting a significant chunk of the presentation to cover its pros and cons, and its usefulness in both my project and in future projects. I learned a lot from this type of development methodology and am going to do a basic knowledge share of how to develop in Gherkin and what benefits it may bring to development teams.
